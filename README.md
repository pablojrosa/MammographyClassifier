# Mammography Classifier Project

The objective of this notebook is to create a complete analysis about the dataset porpused by [Frank Kane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkane/) 
as a final project of the course provided at Udemy called [Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/) 
that i highly recomend you if believes that you belongs the field of data.

Also, at the end of this notebook, you will find a competition between differents machine learning
models (Desition Trees, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and Neural networks)

Finally this job returns the winner model, trained and ready to be used. The aim is simulate the behaviour of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) which objective is to help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious lesion.


What you're going to find here?

âœ… Data QA
- Dimensions of dataset.
- Data type.
- Detect nulls, na and duplicates.
- Develop an estrategy about the results mentiones above.
- Detect inconsistences and develop a strategy about ones found.
- Conclusions about Data QA

ðŸ“Š Reporting
- Univariate analysis.
- Detect outliers and develop and strategy to treat them.
- Bivariate analysis.
- Distribution of features respect to the target
- Conclusions about Reporting

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
- Prepocess data (dummies, encoders, normalize, etc)
- Develop Machine learning models (Desition Trees, Random forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, NN provided by Keras)
- Tune hyperparams.
- Mesure all models.
- Feature importance for the model selected.
- Conclusions about Machine Learning.


Hope you enjoy that! Let's move on!
